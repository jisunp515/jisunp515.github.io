  abstract    = {The optimized gradient method (OGM) provides a factor-$\sqrt{2}$ speedup upon Nesterov's celebrated accelerated gradient method in the convex (but non-strongly convex) setup.
  However, this improved acceleration mechanism has not been well understood; prior analyses of OGM relied on a computer-assisted proof methodology, so the proofs were opaque for humans despite being verifiable and correct.
  In this work, we present a new analysis of OGM based on a Lyapunov function and linear coupling.
  These analyses are developed and presented without the assistance of computers and are understandable by humans. Furthermore, we generalize OGM's acceleration mechanism and obtain a factor-$\sqrt{2}$ speedup in other setups:
  acceleration with a simpler rational stepsize, the strongly convex setup, and the mirror descent setup.},

  abstract    = {Despite the broad use of fixed-point iterations throughout applied mathematics,
  the optimal convergence rate of general fixed-point problems with nonexpansive nonlinear operators has not been established.
  This work presents an acceleration mechanism for fixed-point iterations with nonexpansive operators,
  contractive operators, and nonexpansive operators satisfying a HÃ¶lder-type growth condition.
  We then provide matching complexity lower bounds to establish the exact optimality of the acceleration mechanisms in the nonexpansive and contractive setups.
  Finally, we provide experiments with CT imaging, optimal transport, and decentralized optimization to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the acceleration mechanism.},
