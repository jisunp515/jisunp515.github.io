- I gave a talk at [2023 SIAM Conference on Optimization (OP23)](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/program/op23),
  which is about my recent works published at ICML'22 and ICML'23.

- Our paper **Accelerated Infeasibility Detection of Constrained Optimization and Fixed-Point Iterations**
has been accepted to the _International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML'23)_ as a poster.
