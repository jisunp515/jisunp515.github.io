  Hello!
  I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Operations Research & Financial Engineering (ORFE) at Princeton University,
  working with Prof. <a href="https://stellato.io/">Bartolomeo Stellato</a>.
  <br>

  <br>
  My research interest lies in mathematical optimization and theoretical aspects of machine learning.
  My recent work is closely related to the classical fixed-point iterations, understanding them in theoretical and practical perspectives and designing the algorithms upon such understandings.
  <br>

  <br>
  I obtained my Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematics Sciences at Seoul National University (SNU).
  My advisor was Prof. <a href="https://ernestryu.com/">Ernest K. Ryu</a>.
