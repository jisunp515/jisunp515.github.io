<body>
    I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Operations Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University, working with Prof. <a href="https://stellato.io/">Bartolomeo Stellato</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    My research interest lies in mathematical optimization and theoretical aspects of machine learning.
    My recent work is closely related to the classical fixed-point iterations, understanding them in theoretical and practical perspectives and designing the algorithms upon such understandings.

    I obtained Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematics Sciences at Seoul National University (SNU).
    My advisor was Prof. <a href="https://ernestryu.com/">Ernest K. Ryu</a>.
