<h3 align="left">About Me</h3>
<hr>

<p align="default" font-size="0.75rem">
  Hello, I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of mathematical sciences at Seoul National University (SNU).
  <br>
  My advisor is prof. <a href="https://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/">Ernest K. Ryu</a>.
  <br>

  <br>
  My research interest lies in mathematical optimization and theoretical aspects of machine learning.
  My recent work is closely related to the classical fixed-point iterations in their theoretical and practical perspectives.
  <br>

  <br>
  Prior to my Ph.D. program, I obtained my B.S. from the department of mathematics education at Seoul National University (SNU).
