<hr>

<p align="default">
  My name is Jisun Park, and I am a Ph.D. student in the department of Mathematical Sciences at Seoul National University (SNU).
  My advisor is prof. <a href="https://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/">Ernest K. Ryu</a>.
  <br>

  <br>
  My research interest lies in mathematical optimization and theoretical aspects of machine learning.
  My recent work is closely related to the classical fixed-point iterations, understanding them in theoretical and practical perspectives.
  <br>

  <br>
  Prior to my Ph.D. program, I obtained my B.Sc. from the department of Mathematics Education at Seoul National University (SNU).
  I also have a teacher's certificate for the Secondary Regular Teacher of Mathematics.
